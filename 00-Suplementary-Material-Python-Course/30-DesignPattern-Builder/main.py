# The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in Python world. 
# Itâ€™s especially useful when you need to create an object 
# with lots of possible configuration options.

# The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single 
# creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object. 
# Builder methods often support chaining 
# (for example, someBuilder.setValueA(1).setValueB(2).create()).

# Conceptual Example: This example illustrates the structure of the Builder design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:
    # What classes does it consist of?
    # What roles do these classes play?
    # In what way the elements of the pattern are related?
